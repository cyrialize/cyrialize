# Me

My name is __Jonathan Cyr__, but please call me __Jonny__. Iâ€™m a programmer.

Online I'm known as __Cyrialize__, it's a combination of my last name and [serialization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serialization). 

My last name is pronounced as SEER/SEAR (whichever, take your pick) and I thought it sounded cool when combined.

# This Website

This website was made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and it's hosted on [Neocities](https://neocities.org/).

For styling I use [water.css](https://kognise.github.io/water.css/). It's a classless CSS theme - you can find more on [CSS Bed](https://www.cssbed.com/).

You can find the source of this website [here](https://github.com/cyrialize/cyrialize).
