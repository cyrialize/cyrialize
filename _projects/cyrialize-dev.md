This website was made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and it's hosted on [Neocities](https://neocities.org/).

For styling I use [water.css](https://kognise.github.io/water.css/). It's a classless CSS theme - you can find more on [CSS Bed](https://www.cssbed.com/).

You can find the source of this website [here](https://github.com/cyrialize/cyrialize).

## Why a classless CSS theme?

Classless CSS theme's are small, easy to use, and require very little custom CSS rules.

## Why Jekyll?

I've always liked Ruby and I think Jekyll is easy to use. I'm not too concerned about compile times since this website is fairly simple.

## Why Neocities?

When I was younger I was really into making websites either on Blogspot (now Blogger) or Geocities. I loved the feeling that anyone, anywhere could make a website. I was attracted to Neocities because of it's mission statement and how it reminded me of how the web used to be.

Also, the [Neocites gem](https://github.com/neocities/neocities-ruby) is super useful and everything is [open source](https://github.com/neocities).
