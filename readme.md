# Cyrialize

https://cyrialize.dev/

Hosted on [Neocities](https://neocities.org/). I use the nifty [Neocities gem](https://github.com/neocities/neocities-ruby).

My workflow consists of two commands:
- `jekyll build` to build `_site`
- `neocities push _site` to recursively upload modified files in `_site`
